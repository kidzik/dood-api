#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

API for [http://dood.pl/ dood.pl] defines communication based on REST methodology. This document do not assume any specific server (or client) implementation, but we try to ensure that API works correctly on [http://dood.pl/api/ http://dood.pl/api/].

= Convention =

According to REST convention all requests are stated in the following form
{{{
/object/action/
}}}

All responses are JSON dictionaries:
{{{
{
    "code": 0,           // integer error/success code
    "data": [            // dictionary of result structures
    ]
}
}}}

If error code is 0 than HTTP response has code 200.
Otherwise it is different than 200.

All sessions must start with `/session/start/` for retriving `session_key`.
All requests except `/session/start/` must contain `session_key` as parameter.

All retrived structures have two fields

|| *field* || *type* || *description* ||
|| `id` || `Integer` || Object identifier unique within model ||
|| `model` || `String` || Model name ||

`id` and `model` uniquely define data object.

In following documentation we assume those conditions and do not include them in each structure or request.
