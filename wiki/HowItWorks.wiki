#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

API for [http://dood.pl/ dood.pl] defines communication based on REST methodology. This document do not assume any specific server (or client) implementation, but we try to ensure that API works correctly on:

  * *[http://dood.pl/api/ http://dood.pl/api/]*

= Convention =

According to REST convention all requests are stated in the following form
{{{
/object/action/
}}}

All responses have JSON format. Please refer to [DataExchangeStructure#Response_format  Response Structure] for details about data exchange structures.

*Pre-Assumptions:*

  # If error code is 0 than HTTP response has code 200. Otherwise it may be different than 200. We try to support [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes standard HTTP error codes] and don't change their meanings. 
  # All sessions must start with `/session/start/` for retriving `session_key`.
  # All requests except those mentioned above must contain `session_key` as parameter. Otherwise 401 HTTP error code is returned (this error is also returned if session expires).
  # All retrived structures have header. Please refer to [Datatypes#Header header structure].

*In following documentation we assume those conditions and we may not include them in each structure or request.*
