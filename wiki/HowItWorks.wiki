#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

API for [http://dood.pl/ dood.pl] defines communication based on REST methodology. This document do not assume any specific server (or client) implementation, but we try to ensure that API works correctly on [http://dood.pl/api/ http://dood.pl/api/].

= Convention =

According to REST convention all requests are stated in the following form
{{{
/object/action/
}}}

All responses have JSON format. See [DataExchangeStructure#Response_format  Response Structure] :

  # If error code is 0 than HTTP response has code 200. Otherwise it is different than 200.
  # All sessions must start with `/session/start/` `/session/login/` or `/session/register` for retriving `session_key`.
  # All requests except those above must contain `session_key` as parameter.
  # All retrived structures have header. See [Datatypes#Header header structure]

*In following documentation we assume those conditions and do not include them in each structure or request.*
