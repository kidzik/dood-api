#summary Location database object spec.

= Location =

|| *Field* || *Type* || *Description* ||
|| `longitude` || `Double` || Longitude || 
|| `latitude` || `Double` || Latitude ||
|| `activity` || `Double (0-1)` || used to determine frequency of synchronizing ||
|| `city` || `String` || City from which businesses and promotions were taken ||
|| `default_city_used` (optional) || `Boolean` || if `true` then requested location was too far away from any business in a database ||

*Note:*
  * total number of ids in `promotions` and `businesses` cannot be larger than 20 

*How to derive synchronizing frequency?*

`activity` tells us how often data chenges for given location.
`1` means that data is updated permanenty, and should be synchronized as many times as possible,
`0` means thst we don't need to synchronize because it does not change at all.

Algorithm of determining frequency depends on client. We don't provide suggested time because it depends on device capabilities - for example it should be more frequent with wi-fi and much less frequent with GPRS.

Example calculations for mobile in pseudo(C)code:
{{{
double activity; // received from server
int wifi;        // 1 for wifi, 0 for GPRS

double time;     // frequency of update in hours
double radius;   // update if user crossed this radius (in km)

time = (2.0f - wifi) * (1.0f - activity);
radius = (2.0f - wifi) * (1.0f - activity);
}}}
